# Sprint 1 Plan

## Sprint Goal

Deliver a functional minimum viable product that allows Dungeon Masters to create, view, edit, and delete NPCs with persistent storage in a hosted Postgres database.

This sprint establishes LoreSmith’s core vertical slice and validates external database connectivity, data persistence, and end-to-end CRUD capability.
